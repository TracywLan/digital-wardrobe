### Name: What2Wear
Description: Your digital closet! Do you always look at a full closet and think "I have nothing to wear!"? Well that wont be a problem anymore! What2Wear is your new digital wardrobe. Add your clothing items, organize them by style or season, and instantly see what’s in your collection. It’s the easy way to manage your closet and keep track of everything you own!


### Background: 
I've always had a hard time of keeping track of what I have in the closet and picking out what I want to wear. With a digital closet, I can check out every clothing piece I own at a glance and quickly pick and match as I desire.

## Next Steps
For my next step, I would like to add a build outfit function. I would like to be able to add clothing pieces from my wardrobe and build and save outfits. I would be able to quickly access looks that I wear often and make the outfit picking process much easier. I also want to add a community section so that other people can share their outfit builds in the community and others users can like and follow that user, as well as be inspired by different users looks.
